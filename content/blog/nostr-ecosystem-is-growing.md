## 🔐 Privacy-First Messaging Is Here

A new app called **White Noise** launched in alpha and offers:

- **Metadata-hiding** DMs (you can’t tell who messaged whom),
- Group chats with **MLS encryption** (used by Signal & Matrix),
- **Built entirely on Nostr relays**, but with enhanced privacy logic.

This opens the door for **truly private communication** without centralized servers or metadata leaks — and it still works with your existing npub!
